	Significant restructuring of the code base
	make_points now takes an argument that specifies the number of new points to be generated

v0.1.15, 2015-09-23

v0.1.14, 2015-09-22
	Updated the Tutorial to reflect the changes for the last few months
	Simplified the object creation from strings in the GUI by importing directly from the namespace.

v0.1.13, 2015-09-03
	Allowed to still import the rest of pySOT when PySide is not found. In this case, the GUI will be unavailable.

v0.1.12, 2015-07-23
	The capping can now take in a general transformation that is used to transform the function values. Default is median capping.
	The Genetic Algorithm now defaults to initialize the population using a symmetric latin hypercube design
	DYCORS uses the remaining evaluation budget to change the probabilities after a restart instead of using the total budget

v0.1.11, 2015-07-22
	Fixed a bug in the capped response surface
	pySOT now internally works on the unit hypercube
	The distance can be passed to the RBF after being computed when generating candidate points so it’s not computed twice anymore
	Fixed some bugs in the candidate functions
	GA and Multi-Search gradient perturb the best solution in the case when the best solution is a previously evaluated point
	Added an additional test for the multi-search strategy

v0.1.10, 2015-07-14
	README.md not uploaded to pypi which caused pip install to fail

	Added a DDS candidate based strategy for searching on the surrogate

v0.1.8, 2015-07-01
	Multi Start Gradient method that uses the L-BFGS-B algorithm to search on the surroagate

v0.1.7, 2015-06-30
	Fixed some parameters (and bugs) to improve the DYCORS results. Using DYCORS together with the genetic algorithm is recommended.
	Added polynomial regression (not yet in the GUI)
	Changed so that candidate points are generated using truncated normal distribution to avoid projections onto the boundary
	Removed some accidental scikit dependencies in the ensemble surrogate

v0.1.6, 2015-06-28

	Bug fixes

v0.1.5, 2015-06-28
	GUI now has support for multiple search strategies and ensemble surrogates
	Reallocation bug in the ensemble surrogates fixed
	Genetic algorithm added to search on the surrogate

v0.1.4, 2015-06-26
	GUI now has improved error handling
	Strategies informs the user if they get constraints when not expecting constraints (and the other way) before the run starts

v0.1.3, 2015-06-26
	Experimental (but not documented) GUI added. You need PySide to use it.
	Changes in testproblems.py to allow external objective functions that implement ProcessWorkerThread
	Added GUI test examples in documentation (Ackley.py, Keane.py, SphereExt.py)

v0.1.2, 2015-06-24
	Changed to using the logging module for all the logging in order to conform to the changes in POAP 0.1.9
	The quiet and stream arguments in the strategies were removed and the tests updated accordingly
	Turned sleeping of in the subprocess test, to avoid platform dependency issues

v0.1.1, 2015-06-21
    	surrogate_optimizer removed, so the user now has to create his own controller
    	constraint_method.py is gone, and the constraint handling is handled in specific strategies instead
    	There are now two strategies, SyncStrategyNoConstraints and SyncStrategyPenalty
    	The search strategies now take a method for providing surrogate predictions rather than keeping a copy of the response surface
    	It is now possible for the user to provide additional points to be added to the initial design, in case a 'good starting point' is known.
    	Ensemble surrogates have been added to the toolbox
    	The strategies takes an additional option 'quiet' so that all of the printing can be avoided if the user wants
    	There is also an option 'stream' in case the printing should be redirected somewhere else, for example to a text file. Default is printing to stdout.
    	Several examples added to pySOT.test

v0.1.0, 2015-06-03
	Initial release

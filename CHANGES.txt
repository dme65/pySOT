v0.1.6, 2015-06-28
	GUI inactivates all buttons but the stop button while running
	Bug fixes

v0.1.5, 2015-06-28
	GUI now has support for multiple search strategies and ensemble surrogates
	Reallocation bug in the ensemble surrogates fixed
	Genetic algorithm added to search on the surrogate

v0.1.4, 2015-06-26
	GUI now has improved error handling 
	Strategies informs the user if they get constraints when not expecting constraints (and the other way) before the run starts

v0.1.3, 2015-06-26
	Experimental (but not documented) GUI added. You need PySide to use it.
	Changes in testproblems.py to allow external objective functions that implement ProcessWorkerThread
	Added GUI test examples in documentation (Ackley.py, Keane.py, SphereExt.py)

v0.1.2, 2015-06-24
	Changed to using the logging module for all the logging in order to conform to the changes in POAP 0.1.9
	The quiet and stream arguments in the strategies were removed and the tests updated accordingly
	Turned sleeping of in the subprocess test, to avoid platform dependency issues

v0.1.1, 2015-06-21
    	surrogate_optimizer removed, so the user now has to create his own controller
    	constraint_method.py is gone, and the constraint handling is handled in specific strategies instead
    	There are now two strategies, SyncStrategyNoConstraints and SyncStrategyPenalty
    	The search strategies now take a method for providing surrogate predictions rather than keeping a copy of the response surface
    	It is now possible for the user to provide additional points to be added to the initial design, in case a 'good starting point' is known.
    	Ensemble surrogates have been added to the toolbox
    	The strategies takes an additional option 'quiet' so that all of the printing can be avoided if the user wants
    	There is also an option 'stream' in case the printing should be redirected somewhere else, for example to a text file. Default is printing to stdout.
    	Several examples added to pySOT.test

v0.1.0, 2015-06-03
	Initial release
